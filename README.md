# 1st-Day-Task

Hello!
In the second problem the task was to compute the area of triangle knowing x1, y1, ... x3, y3, but not a, b, alpha. Please carefully check this.
In the third task I got wrong output: 
0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 
1 1
Ne vhodit - should be "Vhodit"

0 out of 2, please correct your solution and let me know in tg when you are ready
